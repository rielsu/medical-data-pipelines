# Description

<!--
The description of a pull request must provide a clear and detailed explanation of the
changes made in the pull request. It should answer the following questions:

- What changes were made?
- Why were these changes made?
- How were these changes implemented?

The description should be written in a way that is easy to understand for other
developers who may be reviewing the pull request. It should be concise and to the point,
but also provide enough context for reviewers to understand the purpose of the changes.

It is also a good practice to include any relevant links or references in the
description, such as links to related issues or documentation.

Titles of pull requests must be concise and descriptive, add the ticket number so it is
easy to identify on the pull request list.

Example: BAS-456: Update README with installation instructions

# How to test

<!--
- What testing was done to ensure it works?

Provide a brief explanation of how to test the feature/change/fix that was implemented.
This is important as it allows other team members to test it, provides context about the
business, and fosters a collaborative environment.

You can add screenshots, videos and such, to provide context if needed.
